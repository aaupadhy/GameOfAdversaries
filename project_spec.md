# Detailed Build Spec: White-Box Embedding Attack on Mistral-7B Safety Head

**Overview**
This spec defines every component and step required to:
1. Fine-tune a safety classification head on a public toxicity dataset.
2. Use that head as a white-box oracle to drive continuous embedding attacks (SDS-style).
3. Verify jailbreaks against the real deployed Mistral-7B filter.
4. Log and visualize results.

All implementation details, dependencies, data transformations, and evaluation criteria are explicitly specified.

## 1. Environment Setup

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.9+
- **Dependencies**: torch ≥ 2.0, transformers, datasets, sentence-transformers, numpy, matplotlib
- **Hardware**: One CUDA GPU with ≥16 GB VRAM
- **Installation Command**:
  ```bash
  pip install torch transformers datasets sentence-transformers matplotlib
  ```

---

## 2. Data Preparation

Use the Jigsaw Toxicity dataset from Hugging Face:

1. **Load Dataset**: Use `datasets.load_dataset("jigsaw_toxicity_predicton")` and select the training split.
2. **Binary Labels**: For each example, set `label = 1` if `toxicity ≥ 0.5`, else `label = 0`.
3. **Split**: Partition into 90% training, 10% validation with a fixed random seed.
4. **Tokenization**:
   - Use the Mistral-7B tokenizer.
   - Truncate or pad all examples to exactly 256 tokens.
5. **Format**: Convert the tokenized inputs and labels into PyTorch-friendly batches.

Deliverable: Two PyTorch datasets (`train_ds`, `val_ds`) yielding `(input_ids, attention_mask, label)`.

## 3. Safety Classifier Fine-Tuning

**Goal**: Train a two-class safety head on top of Mistral-7B to predict harmful vs. benign.

1. **Model Architecture**:
   - Base: Pre-trained `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` without any weight changes.
   - Head: A single linear layer mapping from the base hidden dimension to 2 output logits.
2. **Training Loop**:
   - Optimizer: AdamW with learning rate 5e-5.
   - Loss: Cross-entropy.
   - Scheduler: Linear warmup-to-zero over all training steps.
   - Batch size: 16
   - Epochs: 3
3. **Validation**: After each epoch, compute accuracy on validation split; save the model whenever validation accuracy improves.
4. **Checkpoint**: Final model state (base + head) saved to `./checkpoints/safety_head.pt`.

Deliverable: A trained weights file and training logs showing loss and validation accuracy per epoch.

## 4. White-Box Safety Oracle

**Purpose**: Provide two operations via a single Python class:

1. `predict_proba(prompt: str) -> float`:
   - Tokenize the prompt, embed via the base model’s embedding layer, then forward through base + head to obtain logits.
   - Apply softmax to obtain `[prob_benign, prob_harmful]`; return `prob_harmful`.
2. `generate(prompt: str, max_new_tokens=128) -> str`:
   - Tokenize the prompt normally and use the base model’s `.generate()` API to produce text.

Constraints:
- Model weights loaded from the checkpoint.
- All torch operations on the GPU if available.

Deliverable: A `SafetyOracle` class with those two methods, returning consistent scores in [0,1].

## 5. Continuous Embedding Attacker

**Attacker Model Architecture**
- The attacker is parameterized **solely** by an additive perturbation tensor ΔE with the **same shape** as the token embeddings of a single prompt: [1 × seq_len × embedding_dim].
- **No additional neural network layers or parameters** are used by default. This direct-perturbation approach:
  1. Provides **maximum flexibility**, allowing each embedding coordinate to be adjusted independently.
  2. Simplifies backpropagation: gradients flow directly into ΔE.
  3. Minimizes overhead—only ΔE is trainable (size ≈ seq_len × 1,536 for Mistral-7B) and optimized via Adam.

_Optional Extension (not required)_: If higher-capacity behavior is desired, ΔE can be produced by a small MLP:
  - Input: original prompt embeddings (shape 1 × seq_len × embedding_dim).
  - MLP: two-layer feed-forward network with hidden size = 512.
  - Output: ΔE (same shape).  
  This adds ≈1M parameters but may capture structured perturbations across tokens.

**Optimization Loop (up to 100 steps)**
1. **Retrieve original embeddings**: tokenize prompt, embed to obtain `orig_embeds`.
2. **Initialize ΔE**: zero tensor matching `orig_embeds`, set `requires_grad=True`.
3. **Iterate**:
   - Compute `pert_embeds = orig_embeds + ΔE`.
   - Query white-box oracle for `harm_prob = predict_proba_from_emb(pert_embeds)`.
   - Compute **Harm Loss**:
     - If `harm_prob > threshold` → `loss_harm = harm_prob`.
     - Else → `loss_harm = harm_prob - alpha × (threshold - harm_prob)`.
   - Compute **Semantic Loss**:
     1. Decode `pert_embeds` by nearest-neighbor projection to tokens → `pert_prompt`.
     2. Compute cosine similarity `sim` between original and perturbed prompts via SBERT.
     3. `loss_sem = 1 - sim`.
   - **Total Loss**: `loss = loss_harm + lambda × loss_sem`.
   - **Update**: one Adam step on ΔE (lr = 1e-3).
   - **Early Stop**: if `harm_prob < threshold`, break.
4. **Finalize**:
   - **Decode** final `orig_embeds + ΔE` via nearest-neighbor to obtain tokens → `pert_prompt`.
   - **Verify**: compute `pert_prob` and, if `pert_prob < threshold`, call `generate(prompt)` for adversarial output.

Deliverable: A pure-perturbation attacker that yields high-fidelity, low-harm embeddings without any separate model weights beyond ΔE.

## 6. Real-World Verification

After collecting all adversarial examples:
1. Instantiate a fresh `SafetyOracle` loading the same checkpoint.
2. For each perturbed prompt labeled as “attack_success”, call `predict_proba(pert_prompt)` on the fresh oracle.
3. Record `real_world_success = (prob < 0.5)`.

Deliverable: A dataset of attack records extended with a boolean column `real_world_success`.

---

## 7. Logging & Visualization

1. **Logger**:
   - Append each attack record as a JSON line to `attacks.jsonl`.
2. **Visualizer**:
   - Read `attacks.jsonl` and generate three plots via `matplotlib`:
     a. Histogram of original vs. perturbed harm probabilities.
     b. Distribution of cosine similarities.
     c. Real-world success rate bar chart.
   - Save PNG files in a `plots/` directory.

Deliverable: `attacks.jsonl` plus `plots/prob_hist.png`, `plots/sim_dist.png`, `plots/success_rate.png`.

---

## 8. End-to-End Workflow

1. Setup environment.
2. Prepare and split data.
3. Fine-tune safety head and save checkpoint.
4. Initialize oracle and attacker.
5. Load list of harmful prompts from `data/harmful_prompts_20000_diverse.csv`.
6. Run `attack()` on each prompt, collecting results.
7. Perform real-world verification.
8. Write logs and generate visualizations.

All parameters (thresholds, learning rates, batch sizes, epochs) are explicitly defined above and must not be assumed.
